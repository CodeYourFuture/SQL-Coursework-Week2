## Submission

Add all your `javascript` files in this folder and create a pull request to submit your homework

## Task

- Create a new NodeJS application called `cyf-ecommerce-api`
- Add Express and nodÂ§e-postgres and make sure you can start the server with `node server.js`
- Add a new GET endpoint `/customers` to return all the customers from the database
- Add a new GET endpoint `/suppliers` to return all the suppliers from the database
- (STRETCH GOAL) Add a new GET endpoint `/products` to return all the product names along with their prices and supplier names.

- Update the previous GET endpoint `/products` to filter the list of products by name using a query parameter, for example `/products?name=Cup`. This endpoint should still work even if you don't use the `name` query parameter!

- Add a new GET endpoint `/customers/:customerId` to load a single customer by ID.

- Add a new POST endpoint `/customers` to create a new customer with name, address, city and country.

- Add a new POST endpoint `/products` to create a new product.

- Add a new POST endpoint `/availability` to create a new product availability (with a price and a supplier id). Check that the price is a positive integer and that both the product and supplier ID's exist in the database, otherwise return an error.

- Add a new POST endpoint `/customers/:customerId/orders` to create a new order (including an order date, and an order reference) for a customer. Check that the customerId corresponds to an existing customer or return an error.

- Add a new PUT endpoint `/customers/:customerId` to update an existing customer (name, address, city and country).

- Add a new DELETE endpoint `/orders/:orderId` to delete an existing order along with all the associated order items.

- Add a new DELETE endpoint `/customers/:customerId` to delete an existing customer only if this customer doesn't have orders.

- Add a new GET endpoint `/customers/:customerId/orders` to load all the orders along with the items in the orders of a specific customer. Especially, the following information should be returned: order references, order dates, product names, unit prices, suppliers and quantities.
